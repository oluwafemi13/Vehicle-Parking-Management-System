# Vehicle-Parking-Management-System
Project Description:
In the modern age. Many people have vehicles. The vehicle is now a basic need. 
Every place is in the process of urbanization. There are many corporate offices and shopping centers etc. 
There are many recreational places where people used to go for refreshments. So, all these places need a parking space where people can park their vehicles safely and easily. 
Every parking area needs a system that records the detail of vehicles to give the facility. These systems might be computerized or non-computerized. 
With the help of a computerized system, we can deliver a good service to a customer who wants to park their vehicle on any organization's premises.

A vehicle parking management system is an automatic system that delivers data processing at a very high speed in a systematic manner. 
Parking is a growing need of the time. The development of this system is very useful in this field area. We can sell this system to any organization. 
By using our system, they can maintain records very easily. Our system covers every area of parking management. In the coming future, 
there will be an excessive need for Vehicle parking management systems.

Technology:
Front End: Asp.net with C#
Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft. 
It is used to develop computer programs for Microsoft Windows, as well as websites, web applications, and web services. 
Visual Studio uses Microsoft software development platforms such as Windows API, Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation, Windows Store, and Microsoft Silverlight. 
It can produce both native code and managed code.

Visual Studio includes a code editor supporting IntelliSense (the code completion component) and code refactoring. 
The integrated debugger works both as a source-level debugger and a machine-level debugger. 
Other built-in tools include a forms designer for building GUI applications, a web designer, a class designer, and a database schema designer. 
It accepts plug-ins that enhance the functionality at almost every level—including adding support for source-control systems (like Subversion) 
and adding new toolsets like editors and visual designers for domain-specific languages or toolsets for other aspects of the software development lifecycle (like the Team Foundation Server client: Team Explorer).

Back End: SQL server
Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft. 
As a database server, it is a software product with the primary function of storing and retrieving data as requested by other software applications—which may run either on the same computer or on another computer across a network (including the Internet).

Microsoft markets at least a dozen different editions of Microsoft SQL Server, aimed at different audiences and for workloads ranging from small single-machine applications to large Internet-facing applications with many concurrent users
